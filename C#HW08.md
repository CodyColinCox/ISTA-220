## Cox, Cody C.

1. What is the diﬀerence between deep copy and shallow copy?
 hallow copy creates a new object and then populates it with references to the child objects found in the original, while deep copy creates a new object and then recursively populates it with copies of the child objects found in the original.

1. What is the value of a reference after you declare and initialize it?
how ever much you needed it to be.

1. How do you declare a value type?
type, assignment operator, value.

1. How do you declare a reference type?

1. Does C# allow you to assign NULL to a value type?
yes, with '?'

1. Can you assign a nullable value type to a non-nullable variable of the same type? Why or why not?
No

1. What is the diﬀerence between the stack and the heap?
stack is allocated memory that is callable directly by the system, and the heap you have to make a reference to it and tell the stack how much space will be needed for storing it on the stack.

1. What does it mean when we say that all classes are specialized types?
classes can be thought of as types whos values are determined by the programmer.

1. What does ref do?
passes an argument by reference instead of value.

1. What does out do?
passes an argument to a method by reference.

1. Describe boxing and unboxing in your own words.
boxing passes the value of a type to an object, unboxing extracts the value that was passed.

1. What does cast do?
By using a cast, you can specify that, in your opinion, the data referenced by an object has a speciﬁc type and that it is safe to reference the object by using that type.
